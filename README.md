Brief: My task is to create a computer designed targeted towards children aged 8-12. The game will require the players to navigate around the area and collect items and avoid hazards. Collecting items will benefit the player by increasing their score, whereas colliding with hazards will decrease the number of lives they have. My game should be timed, with player performance based on the score achieved over a certain time. My game should also have levels of difficulty with more difficulty levels having more hazards, fewer lives, or shorter time. My game should be exciting and fun to play, as well as visually appealing.
